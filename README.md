# Island_health_assignment
Assignment Overview 
In this assignment, you will connect to an SQLite database containing information about patients tested for MRSA, CDI, and COVID-19. You will run some analytics on the data and develop insights into the patient distribution, infection rates, and treatment effectiveness.

I have worked on a project based on a Shiny app, which allows users to interact with various objects such as filters in graphics, similar to Power BI. The Shiny app can be accessed at the following link: [Island Health Assignment Shiny App.](https://alina-tkachenko.shinyapps.io/Island_Health_assignment/)

The main focus of the project was on analyzing treatment features. The app provides an interactive environment where users can explore the data and visualize different aspects of the treatment data.

Additionally, I have included a file called "assignment reflections" which documents the initial steps in data analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and basic plotting. However, not all of these plots were included in the final version of the app due to its simplicity. Some basic and exploratory plots were created using Power BI for generating ideas, but they were not necessary in the final dashboard.

Feel free to explore the Shiny app
